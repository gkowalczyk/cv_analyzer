# CV Analyzer

**CV Analyzer** is an application based on **Spring Boot** and **Spring AI** that allows you to analyze your CV in PDF format.  
By leveraging the **OpenAI API** and integrating with the **Just Join IT** platform, the application automatically matches the best job offers tailored to your CV.

I am planning future integrations with other popular job portals such as **No Fluff Jobs** and **Bulldogjob**.
